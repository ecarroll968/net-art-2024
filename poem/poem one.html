  <p>I absolutely adore observing a stunning and breathtaking sunset,
  when summer is drifting towards the fall.
  Ruby red tinged clouds <br>I can not <br>forget  -
  they are the most <br> sight of them all!</p>
  
  <p>Twilight has arrived, to another day I must bid adieu</p>
  <h2> as scarlet skies transform</h2> <br>to an inky and &nbsp;velvety blu
  <p>Why the sunset is my favorite</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is bright</li>
    <li>It is beautiful</li>
    <li>It is calming</li>
    <li>It is memorable</li>
  </ol>


  There are other reasons why I love the sunset and when seasons change
  <ul>
    <li>The cool fall breeze feels amazing</li>
    <li>I enjoy apple cider</li>
    <li>I get to spend time with my family because of increased holidays</li>
    <li>I am able to wear more sweaters</li>
  </ul>
  Fall is <strong> amazing!</strong>
  <hr>
  I am so <em>grateful</em>to be able to see the seasons change
